Silhouette refers to a method of interpretation and validation of consistency within clusters of data. The technique provide a succinct graphical representation of how well each pobject has been classified.

The Silhouette value is a measure of how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compare to the other clusters (separation). The Silhouette ranges from -1 to +1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighbouring clusters. If most objects have a high value, thenthe clustering configuration is appropriate. If many points have a low or negativevalue, then the clustering configuration may have too many or too few clusters.

The silhouette can be calculated with any distance metric, such as the Euclidenan distance or the Manhattan distance.

Assume the data have been clustered via technique, k-mediods or k-means, into k clusters.

For each data point **i** in the cluster C we have,
    a(i), is the mean distance between i and all other data points in the same cluster. We can interpret a(i) as a measure for how well **i** is assigned to it's cluster (the smaller the value, the better the assignment).


The Silhouette(value) of one data point i, s(i):
        where, s(i) lies between -1 and 1.
